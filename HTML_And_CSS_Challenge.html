				tongue, Shar-Pei dogs are easy to spot in a crowd. Before adopting a Shar-Pei, 
				it’s essential that you are first familiar with the breed and what it takes to 
				be a parent to one. Helpful items to consider are their personality, 
				temperament, and grooming needs.</p>

				fruit was actually Terry’s Chocolate Apple! However, the taste of Terry’s 
				Chocolate Apple pales in comparison to the delicious Chocolate Orange.</p>
